# Quote Generator

This is a simple **Quote Generator** app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app displays programming quotes and allows users to generate a new quote by clicking a button or pressing the spacebar. Additionally, users can copy the displayed quote (along with the author) to their clipboard with one click.

## Features

- **Generate Random Quotes:** Clicking the "Generate" button or pressing the spacebar displays a random programming quote.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Users can copy both the quote and its author with the "Copy" button.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to work on all screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- **Simple and Clean UI:** The user interface is minimalistic, making it easy to focus on the quotes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the structure of the page.
- **CSS3** for styling the page and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** for handling user interactions, generating random quotes, and copying to clipboard.
- **Clipboard API** for copying the quote and author to the clipboard.
